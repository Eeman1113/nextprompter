# 🚀 Nextprompter: The Next.js File Whisperer 🗣️

Welcome to Nextprompter, where your Next.js files come to party and your prompts come to life! 🎉

## What in the React is this? 🤔

Nextprompter is your friendly neighborhood Next.js file collector with a twist. It's like a vacuum cleaner for your code, but instead of collecting dust, it collects .js files and sprinkles them with the magic of your imagination!

## Features That'll Make You Go "Ooh" and "Aah" 😮

- 🕵️‍♂️ Sneaks through your Next.js project like a code ninja
- 🙅‍♂️ Gives `node_modules` the cold shoulder (sorry, not sorry)
- 🍒 Cherry-picks your favorite .js files
- 🧙‍♀️ Lets you cast a spell (aka prompt) on your chosen files
- 🎭 Previews your masterpiece before the grand finale
- 🎁 Gift-wraps your code and prompt into a neat little package

## How to Summon This Genie 🧞‍♂️

1. Clone this repo faster than you can say "React hooks"
2. Install the magical dependencies:
   ```
   pip install streamlit faster-than-light
   ```
   (Okay, maybe not faster-than-light. But a dev can dream, right?)
3. Wave your wand (or just type in your terminal):
   ```
   streamlit run nextprompter.py
   ```
4. Follow the enchanted instructions on your screen

## Warning ⚠️

Side effects may include:
- Sudden urges to reorganize your sock drawer using React components
- Dreaming in JSX
- Uncontrollable desire to tell "useState" puns at parties
